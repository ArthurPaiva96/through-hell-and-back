# Through Hell and Back

I made this 2D side-scroller-like game to learn a bit about Unity, C#, how to handle assets and, game development. Because of that, I ended up lefting the final touches unfinished.

In this game, you play as a mage going through hell and fighting monsters. You have to keep using your flying spell to not die to the monsters walking on the ground while dodging obstacles and killing the airborne monsters.

# Controls

**Up arrow:** Fly magic (air jump)
**Space bar:** Magic shot (kills airborne monsters)
**Left arrow:** The player moves to the left
**Right arrow:** The player moves to the right

# Enemies

**Skeletons soldiers:** An ongoing stream of enemies that walk on the ground.
**Eye monster:** Flying monsters that only move forward.
**Bird monster:** Flying monsters that move up and down while going forward.
**Demon:** The demons shot fireballs that can kill the player. They also move forward.

Killing an enemy gives the player 1 point. The player's points can be seen at the top right corner of the screen.

# Obstacle

**Black arms:** They appear from hell's sky and ground killing the player on contact. The magic shot can make them disappear.

# Unfinished mechanics

- Restart the game after a game over.
- **Bird monsters**, **Demons** and **Black arms" only appearing after the player gets a certain amount of points(a number of points for each one).
- A final boss that appears after a certain amount of points.
